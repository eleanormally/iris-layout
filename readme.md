 # My Iris Keyboard Layout 

This repository is dedicated to my current layout for my iris keyboard from [keeb.io](https://keeb.io/collections/iris-split-ergonomic-keyboard)

If you would like to use this layout, please refer to the official QMK documentation on how to compile the firmware and flash it onto your keyboard.
